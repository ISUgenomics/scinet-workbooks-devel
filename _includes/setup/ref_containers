The [/reference/containers](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/software/singularity#ceres-container-repository) location provides a collection of (~100) pre-built software containers maintained by the system administrators. All users can access and run these containers on both Atlas and Ceres supercomputers, ensuring reproducibility and saving time when setting up pipelines.

ls -lh /reference/data

This directory contains downloaded container images that can be executed with [Apptainer](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/software/singularity#executing-containers) (e.g., `apptainer run`, `apptainer exec`). Many of them can be loaded as [environment modules](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/software/preinstalled#ceres-command-line-software-managed-by-the-module-system), allowing users to run pre-configured software directly (e.g., `salmon -h`) without manual installation or invoking Apptainer. Containers should be executed on a [compute node](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/software/singularity#prerequisites) or submitted to the [SLURM queue](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/use/slurm#slurm-resource-manager).
