[/90daydata/shared directory](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/data/storage#large-short-term-storage) is open to all users on Ceres and Atlas. 
This location is intended to support collaboration between groups and to optimize storage by minimizing redundant copies of the same data. 
Files older than 90 days will be automatically deleted.   

Anyone can create a nested directory in this location and put data:
```bash
cd /90daydata/shared     # navigate to shared workspace
mkdir -p $USER           # create a subfolder for your user <first.last>
cd $USER                 # enter the subfolder
pwd                      # check the absolute path, e.g., /90daydata/shared/alex.badacz
cp /aboslute_path/to/<source_of_data> /90daydata/shared/$USER/   # transfer data
```

Data will be readable by everyone on the system unless file owner [limits access permissions](http://127.0.0.1:4500/computing-skills/command-line/#understanding-and-changing-file-permissions).

<details markdown="1"><summary><b>Update access dates to retain files</b></summary>
When you transferring archived files, they may contain files with an access date from long ago. 
This date will still trigger deletion, so make sure that the files have a new access date. 
- When extracting a `.tar` or `.tgz` archive, use the `-m` flag. 
```bash
tar -xvzmf archive.tgz
```
- When transferring files with `rsync`, avoid the `-a` flag.
```bash
rsync -vz --no-p --no-g <local_dir> <SCINetID>@ceres-dtn.scinet.usda.gov:/90daydata/<project_name>
```
