[/90daydata/shared directory](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/data/storage#large-short-term-storage) is open to all users on Ceres and Atlas. 
Anyone can create a nested directory in this location and put data which will be readable by everyone on the system unless file owner limits access using `chmod` command. 
Files older than 90 days will be automatically deleted.  
This location is intended to support collaboration between groups and to optimize storage by minimizing redundant copies of the same data.

<details markdown="1"><summary><b>Update access dates to retain files</b></summary>
When you transferring archived files, they may contain files with an access date from long ago. 
This date will still trigger deletion, so make sure that the files have a new access date. 
- When extracting a `.tar` or `.tgz` archive, use the `-m` flag. 
```bash
tar -xvzmf archive.tgz
```
- When transferring files with `rsync`, avoid the `-a` flag.
```bash
rsync -vz --no-p --no-g <local_dir> <SCINetID>@ceres-dtn.scinet.usda.gov:/90daydata/<project_name>
```
