* With **SCINet account** you get small storage quota (30GB) in your `/home/<user.name>/` directory. This is a personal storage space assigned to an individual user.
* As a member of ARS **research project**, you get access to group-shared large storage quota (e.g., 1TB) in a specific `/project/<project_name/>` directory and `/90daydata/<project_name>/` space for unlimited but temporary files (with 90-day auto-purge policy). *Ask your PI to be added to the [project group](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/data/storage#project-directories).*
* **Everyone** has access to shared space in `/90daydata/shared` dedicated for cross-group collaboration and to `$TMPDIR` when using a compute node.
