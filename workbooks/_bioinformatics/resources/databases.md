type: reference material

objectives: 
  - Understand the role of public databases in storing, curating, and sharing biological data.  
  - Recognize the scope and focus of major bioinformatics databases.  
  - Learn how to access, query, and download relevant datasets.  
  - Develop awareness of data integration across different databases.  

applications:
  - Retrieving reference genomes, transcriptomes, and protein sequences.  
  - Obtaining annotation files for genomic features.  
  - Accessing curated variant and disease-associated datasets.  
  - Using specialized repositories to guide experimental design and validation.  

terms: [Primary Database, Secondary Database, Data Curation, Accession Number, Metadata]

takeaways: 
  - Always check the primary source of data and the version (e.g., genome assembly build, annotation release).  
  - Be aware of redundancy and overlap - some databases mirror or repackage others.  
  - Use stable identifiers (accession numbers, Ensembl IDs, UniProt IDs) for reproducibility.  
  - Combine multiple resources to cross-validate and enrich analysis, but track provenance.  
  - Pay attention to update cycles - newer is not always better for reproducibility.

## Overview

Bioinformatics depends on **public databases** to store, organize, and share the vast amounts of biological data generated worldwide. 
These resources provide access to curated reference genomes, protein sequences, functional annotations, and clinical variants. 
They act as the foundation of reproducible research, ensuring that scientists across disciplines can work with consistent, validated, and accessible datasets.  

In this reference material, you will explore the major bioinformatics databases used in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. 
You’ll learn what each database contains, how to access it online, and why version tracking and stable identifiers are critical for reliable analyses.

## The role of public databases

Modern bioinformatics would not be possible without centralized, publicly available databases. 
They serve as the **infrastructure for biological discovery**, enabling researchers to access reference genomes, protein sequences, and curated annotations without recreating datasets from scratch. 
Public repositories ensure **consistency and transparency**, allowing results to be compared across studies and tools. 
They also act as **long-term archives**, preserving data generated by large international consortia as well as individual research groups.  

#### Why public databases matter?

- provide centralized access to reference data  
- reduce redundancy and duplication of effort  
- support interoperability between tools and formats  


## Primary vs. secondary databases

Databases can be broadly divided into *primary* and *secondary* resources.  

| Database     | Content | Examples | Role |
|--------------|---------|----------|------|
| **primary**  | collect raw experimental data submitted directly by researchers     | nucleotide sequences (`GenBank`, `ENA`, `DDBJ`) or high-throughput reads (`SRA`) | These repositories function as global archives for raw data retieval. |  
|**secondary** | provide high-quality sequences, annotations and specialized subsets | e.g., `RefSeq` (non-redundant reference sequences) or `UniProt` (protein function and structure) | These repositories reprocess, annotate, and curate data from primary sources. |

Understanding this distinction helps you choose the right source:  
- turn to **primary databases** when you need the *original, unprocessed experimental data*,  
- use **secondary databases** when you need *curated, standardized datasets* that are ready for analysis.  
 
<div class="highlighted highlighted--warning ">
<div class="highlighted__body"  markdown="1">
<h4 class="highlighted__heading">Before choosing a database</h4>
- **Primary databases** archive all submitted data, which means they may include redundant entries, unverified sequences, or low-quality submissions.  
- **Secondary databases** apply curation and filtering, but in doing so may omit rare variants, novel transcripts, or preliminary annotations.  

Always confirm which resource a tool or pipeline expects - using the wrong source can lead to mismatches in identifiers, missing features, or inconsistent results.  
</div>
</div>


## Standards, identifiers, curation

Databases adopt **standardized formats** (e.g., [FASTA](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#fasta) for sequences, 
[GTF](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#gtf)/[GFF](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#gff) for annotations, 
[VCF](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#vcf--bcf) for variants) to ensure interoperability with analysis tools. 
This consistency allows researchers to combine data from multiple sources, run them through shared pipelines, and reproduce analyses without manual reformatting.  

Every database entry is tagged with a **stable identifier** (*accession number*, *Ensembl ID*, *UniProt ID*), which acts as a permanent reference. 
This is essential for reproducibility, since gene names, annotations, and sequence versions may change over time, but the identifier remains constant.  

Finally, one of the greatest strengths of public databases lies in their use of **curation**. 
Some rely on *automated pipelines* to process submissions, while others involve *expert manual review* (e.g., `GENCODE`, `Swiss-Prot`). 
Both approaches aim to improve data quality, but awareness of their scope is essential when interpreting results.

### ★ Sequence databases

The foundation of bioinformatics is built on sequence repositories. Three **primary nucleotide archives**: [GenBank](#genbank), [ENA](#ena), and [DDBJ](#ddbj), 
operate as a unified system under the *International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)*. Submissions to any one archive are synchronized across all three, 
ensuring a globally consistent, comprehensive collection of sequence data. Beyond raw archival data, **curated secondary resources** such as [RefSeq](#refseq) or [miRBase](#mirbase) 
provide **non-redundant reference sequences** for genes, transcripts, proteins, and non-coding RNAs.

### ★ Genomes, Annotations

Beyond [raw sequence repositories](#-sequence-databases), bioinformatics relies on resources that provide **reference genomes** 
and **structured annotations** of genes, transcripts, and genomic features. Databases such as [Ensembl](#ensembl), the [UCSC Genome Browser](#ucsc-genome-browser), 
and [GENCODE](#gencode) deliver curated gene models, coordinate systems, and visualization tools, forming the foundation for alignment, 
variant interpretation, and transcriptomic analysis. These resources ensure that analyses are anchored to well-defined, versioned reference assemblies and annotation sets.

### ★ Variant databases

To interpret genetic differences, researchers rely on databases that catalog **genomic variants** across populations and individuals. 
Core resources include [dbSNP](#dbsnp), [ClinVar](#clinvar), and the [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org), along with specialized databases 
such as [gnomAD](#gnomad) (population allele frequencies), **COSMIC** (cancer mutations), and **HGMD** (heritable disease mutations). 
These variant databases are essential for tasks such as calling variants from sequencing data, annotating their functional effects, 
and linking them to disease phenotypes or evolutionary patterns.

### ★ Gene Expression

Understanding **gene expression patterns** and functional responses is central to genomics research. Bioinformatics workflows rely on repositories that archive **raw and processed transcriptomic data**, 
capturing expression profiles across tissues, conditions, diseases, and treatments. Key public resources include the [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](#sra) for primary sequencing reads, 
[ArrayExpress](#arrayexpress) for microarray and RNA-seq data submissions with rich experimental metadata, and the [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](#geo) for curated gene expression datasets. 
These resources support downstream analyses such as differential expression, co-expression network inference, meta-analysis, and biomarker discovery.

### ★ Functional enrichment

To interpret large gene or protein lists from high-throughput experiments, bioinformatics relies on resources that capture biological meaning through structured vocabularies and curated pathways. 
**Functional enrichment analysis** enables researchers to connect differential expression, variant impact, or proteomic profiles to known **biological processes**, **molecular functions**, and **pathways**. 
Key resources in this space include the [Gene Ontology (GO)](#gene-ontology-go) for standardized function classification, [KEGG](#kegg) for curated maps of metabolic and signaling pathways, 
and [Reactome](#reactome) for expert-reviewed molecular interaction networks. These databases power enrichment tools (e.g., GSEA, DAVID, clusterProfiler) 
and support systems-level interpretations of omics data across species and contexts.

### ★ Protein databases

Protein-focused bioinformatics resources provide reference data for studying **sequence**, **structure**, and **function** of proteins and their interactions. 
These databases are critical for tasks such as **functional annotation**, **variant interpretation**, **protein modeling**, and **structure-based drug discovery**. 
[UniProt](#uniprot) offers a comprehensive, curated catalog of protein sequences, isoforms, domains, and functional annotations across species, 
integrating experimental and predicted data. The [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](#pdb) archives experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins, DNA/RNA, and complexes, 
enabling structural biology, docking studies, and mechanistic modeling of molecular function.

## Practical guidance

<div class="process-list ul" markdown="1">

### Efficient downloads

Large biological datasets (e.g., genomes, raw reads, daily database updates) can be many gigabytes in size. 
Downloading them with plain `wget` works, but it may be slow or prone to interruption. 
Tools like **`aria2c`** and **Aspera (`ascp`)** offer faster, more reliable alternatives. 

*Use optimized tools and replace the FTP/HTTP link with the address of the file you need.* 
- use **FTP** for bulk dumps,  
- use **EDirect** for specific records by accession  


**`wget`** (simple & robust)
```bash
wget -c ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/gbdaily.seq.gz
```
`-c` allows resume if interrupted.


**`aria2c`** (multi-connection downloader)
```bash
# Split file into 8 segments, download in parallel
aria2c -x 8 -s 8 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/gbdaily.seq.gz
aria2c -x 8 -s 8 ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR000/ERR000111/ERR000111.fastq.gz
```

**`ascp`** (Aspera; much faster for raw reads)
- only from [ENA](#ena)/[SRA](#sra) databases
```bash
ascp -QT -l 300m -P33001 \
    era-fasp@fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR000/ERR000111/ERR000111.fastq.gz ERR000111.fastq.gz
```

**`esearch`** (NCBI EDirect; download by accession across INSDC)
```bash
# Fetch a nucleotide sequence in FASTA format
esearch -db nucleotide -query "NC_001666.2" | efetch -format fasta > corn_chloroplast.fasta

# Fetch the same record with full annotations (GenBank flatfile)
esearch -db nucleotide -query "NC_001666.2" | efetch -format gb > corn_chloroplast.gb

# Fetch raw read metadata by SRA/DRA/ERA accession
esearch -db sra -query "DRR000001" | efetch -format runinfo > DRR000001.csv
```
