  - Understand the role of public databases in storing, curating, and sharing biological data.  
  - Recognize the scope and focus of major bioinformatics databases.  
  - Learn how to access, query, and download relevant datasets.  
  - Develop awareness of data integration across different databases.  

applications:
  - Retrieving reference genomes, transcriptomes, and protein sequences.  
  - Obtaining annotation files for genomic features.  
  - Accessing curated variant and disease-associated datasets.  
  - Using specialized repositories to guide experimental design and validation.  

terms: [Primary Database, Secondary Database, Data Curation, Accession Number, Metadata]

takeaways: 
  - Always check the primary source of data and the version (e.g., genome assembly build, annotation release).  
  - Be aware of redundancy and overlap - some databases mirror or repackage others.  
  - Use stable identifiers (accession numbers, Ensembl IDs, UniProt IDs) for reproducibility.  
  - Combine multiple resources to cross-validate and enrich analysis, but track provenance.  
  - Pay attention to update cycles - newer is not always better for reproducibility.

## Overview

Bioinformatics depends on **public databases** to store, organize, and share the vast amounts of biological data generated worldwide. 
These resources provide access to curated reference genomes, protein sequences, functional annotations, and clinical variants. 
They act as the foundation of reproducible research, ensuring that scientists across disciplines can work with consistent, validated, and accessible datasets.  

In this reference material, you will explore the major bioinformatics databases used in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. 
You’ll learn what each database contains, how to access it online, and why version tracking and stable identifiers are critical for reliable analyses.  

{% include overviews %}


## The role of public databases

Modern bioinformatics would not be possible without centralized, publicly available databases. 
They serve as the **infrastructure for biological discovery**, enabling researchers to access reference genomes, protein sequences, and curated annotations without recreating datasets from scratch. 
Public repositories ensure **consistency and transparency**, allowing results to be compared across studies and tools. 
They also act as **long-term archives**, preserving data generated by large international consortia as well as individual research groups.  

#### Why public databases matter?

- provide centralized access to reference data  
- reduce redundancy and duplication of effort  
- support interoperability between tools and formats  


## Primary vs. secondary databases

Databases can be broadly divided into *primary* and *secondary* resources.  

| Database     | Content | Examples | Role |
|--------------|---------|----------|------|
| **primary**  | collect raw experimental data submitted directly by researchers     | nucleotide sequences (`GenBank`, `ENA`, `DDBJ`) or high-throughput reads (`SRA`) | These repositories function as global archives for raw data retieval. |  
|**secondary** | provide high-quality sequences, annotations and specialized subsets | e.g., `RefSeq` (non-redundant reference sequences) or `UniProt` (protein function and structure) | These repositories reprocess, annotate, and curate data from primary sources. |

Understanding this distinction helps you choose the right source:  
- turn to **primary databases** when you need the *original, unprocessed experimental data*,  
- use **secondary databases** when you need *curated, standardized datasets* that are ready for analysis.  
 
<div class="highlighted highlighted--warning ">
<div class="highlighted__body"  markdown="1">
<h4 class="highlighted__heading">Before choosing a database</h4>
- **Primary databases** archive all submitted data, which means they may include redundant entries, unverified sequences, or low-quality submissions.  
- **Secondary databases** apply curation and filtering, but in doing so may omit rare variants, novel transcripts, or preliminary annotations.  

Always confirm which resource a tool or pipeline expects - using the wrong source can lead to mismatches in identifiers, missing features, or inconsistent results.  
</div>
</div>


## Standards, identifiers, curation

Databases adopt **standardized formats** (e.g., [FASTA](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#fasta) for sequences, 
[GTF](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#gtf)/[GFF](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#gff) for annotations, 
[VCF](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#vcf--bcf) for variants) to ensure interoperability with analysis tools. 
This consistency allows researchers to combine data from multiple sources, run them through shared pipelines, and reproduce analyses without manual reformatting.  

Every database entry is tagged with a **stable identifier** (*accession number*, *Ensembl ID*, *UniProt ID*), which acts as a permanent reference. 
This is essential for reproducibility, since gene names, annotations, and sequence versions may change over time, but the identifier remains constant.  

Finally, one of the greatest strengths of public databases lies in their use of **curation**. 
Some rely on *automated pipelines* to process submissions, while others involve *expert manual review* (e.g., `GENCODE`, `Swiss-Prot`). 
Both approaches aim to improve data quality, but awareness of their scope is essential when interpreting results.

### ➔ Sequence databases

The foundation of bioinformatics is built on sequence repositories. Three **primary nucleotide archives**: [GenBank](#genbank), [ENA](#ena), and [DDBJ](#ddbj), 
operate as a unified system under the *International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration ([INSDC](https://www.insdc.org))*. Submissions to any one archive are synchronized across all three, 
ensuring a globally consistent, comprehensive collection of sequence data. Beyond raw archival data, **curated secondary resources** such as [RefSeq](#refseq) or [miRBase](#mirbase) 
provide **non-redundant reference sequences** for genes, transcripts, proteins, and non-coding RNAs.

**Scope:** nucleotide sequences (DNA, RNA; assembled and unassembled) 

<div class="usa-accordion" style="margin-top: 1em;">

{% include accordion title="Characteristics" class=" " controls="genbank-1" icon=false %}
<div id="genbank-1" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC); daily data exchange with ENA and DDBJ  
- global public repository for **all nucleotide sequence submissions**, from individual labs and large sequencing centers  
- accepts sequences across species, from genomes to plasmids, ESTs, and synthetic  
- **identifiers:** *accession numbers* (stable) and *GI numbers* (deprecated but still encountered in legacy data)  
- **data formats:** `FASTA`, `GenBank flatfile` (rich annotation), `ASN.1` (internal format)  

</div>

{% include accordion title="Applications" class=" " controls="genbank-2" icon=false %}
<div id="genbank-2" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- retrieve nucleotide sequences for **comparative genomics, primer design, or database building**  
- access **legacy or unusual sequences** not yet in curated references (e.g., novel virus)  
- essential for **BLAST searches**, since it pulls directly from GenBank’s sequence archive  

Tools like **Prokka**, **funannotate**, **BLAST+**, or **Biopython** may require GenBank-format files locally, but many workflows only need to download specific entries on demand.

</div>

{% include accordion title="Limitations" class=" " controls="genbank-3" icon=false %}
<div id="genbank-3" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- **redundancy**: multiple submissions of the same sequence may exist, with differences  
- **annotation quality**: metadata is submitted by researchers and not always standardized  
- naming inconsistencies between submissions can complicate automated pipelines  

</div>

{% include accordion title="Practical Tips" class=" " controls="genbank-4" icon=false %}
<div id="genbank-4" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- keep track of **GenBank release version** (updated biweekly) to ensure consistent results in long-term projects  
- always use **accession numbers** when citing sequences (gene names can change)  
- when downloading large datasets, use **[NCBI FTP/rsync mirrors](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)** for efficiency  
- check if a curated **[RefSeq](#refseq) record** is available for your sequence of interest (more stable for downstream use)  

</div>

{% include accordion title="CLI download" class=" " controls="genbank-5" icon=false %}
<div id="genbank-5" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>
Due to the large size of GenBank, it’s not typical to download the entire database. 
Instead, specific entries are usually retrieved on demand using tools like [Entrez Direct](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/) ( module `edirect`), 
`ncbi-genome-download`, or via programmatic access through `Biopython`.

GenBank entries can be downloaded from the NCBI FTP server: <https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/>  

1. Download/synchronize the latest complete release (compressed):  
```bash
rsync -av rsync://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/ .
```

2. Download a subset (e.g., viral sequences, compressed FASTA):
```bash
wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/gbvrl1.seq.gz
```

3. Fetch sequences by accession using [NCBI EDirect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/) command-line utilities:  
```bash
module load edirect        
# or user-install if not available
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/entrezdirect/install-edirect.sh)"
```
```bash
# Fetch a Zea mays (corn) chloroplast sequence in FASTA format
esearch -db nucleotide -query "NC_001666.2" | efetch -format fasta > corn_chloroplast.fasta
# Fetch the same record in GenBank flatfile format (with annotations)

- part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC); daily data exchange with GenBank and DDBJ  
- accepts **assembled sequences, raw reads, and project metadata**  
- backbone of Europe’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA)  
- **identifiers:** ENA accession numbers (e.g., *PRJEB*, *ERR*, *SRR* via NCBI synchronization)  
- **data formats:** `FASTA`, `FASTQ`, XML metadata; compressed archives for raw data  

</div>

{% include accordion title="Applications" class=" " controls="ena-2" icon=false %}
<div id="ena-2" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- retrieve **raw read datasets** for reanalysis or benchmarking  
- access **assembled sequences** with associated experimental metadata  
- integrate with European bioinformatics pipelines (e.g., [EMBL-EBI services](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/services/))  
- often used in **meta-analyses** where raw reads are required  

</div>

{% include accordion title="Limitations" class=" " controls="ena-3" icon=false %}
<div id="ena-3" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- data volume is very large; downloads can be slow without optimized tools  
- metadata submission quality varies between projects

</div>

{% include accordion title="Practical Tips" class=" " controls="ena-4" icon=false %}
<div id="ena-4" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- use **accession numbers** consistently (`PRJEB`, `ERR`, `SRR`) to map across INSDC collab.  
- prefer the **Aspera client** (`ascp`) or `ftp/rsync` for bulk downloads (faster than HTTP)  
- [ENA browser](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/search) allows **programmatic queries** with filters (species, platform, etc.)  
- when working with raw reads, check if the data is already in **processed form** (e.g., via [RefSeq](#refseq) or [SRA](#sra)) before downloading terabytes unnecessarily  

</div>

{% include accordion title="CLI download" class=" " controls="ena-5" icon=false %}
<div id="ena-5" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>
Due to its large and overlapping content with [GenBank](#genbank)/[RefSeq](#refseq), it's also uncommon to mirror ENA entirely. 
Instead, specific records (assemblies, reads, etc.) are typically retrieved on demand using tools like ENA Browser CLI, enaDataGet, aspera (ascp), or wget/curl based on accession numbers.

ENA FTP server: <https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/>  

1. Download example record (FASTA):
```bash
wget ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/ena/wgs/public/aaz/AAZXAA01.fasta.gz
```

2. Download raw reads by accession (e.g., ERR000100 read set (728M x2), FASTQ compressed):
```bash
wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR000/ERR000100/ERR000100_1.fastq.gz
wget https://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR000/ERR000100/ERR000100_2.fastq.g
```

3. Download with Aspera (faster than FTP):
```bash
ascp -T -l 300m -P33001 \
    era-fasp@fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR000/ERR000100/ERR000100_1.fastq.gz ERR000100.fastq.gz

Like [GenBank](#genbank), RefSeq is a large, curated database of genomic, transcript, and protein sequences maintained by NCBI. 
Due to its size, it’s not typical to download the entire resource. Instead, users typically retrieve specific genomes or sequences on demand using 
`ncbi-genome-download`, [Entrez Direct](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/) (module `edirect`), `rsync` from NCBI FTP/Aspera or datasets CLI (`ncbi-datasets-pylib`).

RefSeq FTP site: <https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/>

### ➔ Genomes, Annotations

Beyond [raw sequence repositories](#sequence-databases), bioinformatics relies on resources that provide **reference genomes** 
and **structured annotations** of genes, transcripts, and genomic features. Databases such as [Ensembl](#ensembl), the [UCSC Genome Browser](#ucsc-genome-browser), 
and [GENCODE](#gencode) deliver curated gene models, coordinate systems, and visualization tools, forming the foundation for alignment, 
variant interpretation, and transcriptomic analysis. These resources ensure that analyses are anchored to well-defined, versioned reference assemblies and annotation sets.  

<div class="usa-accordion " >

### ➔ Variant databases

To interpret genetic differences, researchers rely on databases that catalog **genomic variants** across populations and individuals. 
Core resources include [dbSNP](#dbsnp), [ClinVar](#clinvar), and the [1000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org), along with specialized databases 
such as [gnomAD](#gnomad) (population allele frequencies), [COSMIC](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/login) (cancer mutations), and [HGMD](https://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/ac/index.php) (heritable disease mutations). 
These variant databases are essential for tasks such as calling variants from sequencing data, annotating their functional effects, 
and linking them to disease phenotypes or evolutionary patterns.

### ➔ Gene Expression

Understanding **gene expression patterns** and functional responses is central to genomics research. Bioinformatics workflows rely on repositories that archive **raw and processed transcriptomic data**, 
capturing expression profiles across tissues, conditions, diseases, and treatments. Key public resources include the [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](#sra) for primary sequencing reads, 
the [Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)](#geo) for curated gene expression datasets, and [ArrayExpress](#arrayexpress) for microarray and RNA-seq data submissions with rich experimental metadata. 
These resources support downstream analyses such as differential expression, co-expression network inference, meta-analysis, and biomarker discovery.

### ➔ Functional enrichment

To interpret large gene or protein lists from high-throughput experiments, bioinformatics relies on resources that capture biological meaning through structured vocabularies and curated pathways. 
**Functional enrichment analysis** enables researchers to connect differential expression, variant impact, or proteomic profiles to known **biological processes**, **molecular functions**, and **pathways**. 
Key resources in this space include the [Gene Ontology (GO)](#gene-ontology-go) for standardized function classification, [KEGG](#kegg) for curated maps of metabolic and signaling pathways, 
and [Reactome](#reactome) for expert-reviewed molecular interaction networks. These databases power enrichment tools (e.g., GSEA, DAVID, clusterProfiler) 
and support systems-level interpretations of omics data across species and contexts.

  - **Molecular Function (MF)** – activities at the molecular level (e.g., kinase activity)  
  - **Cellular Component (CC)** – locations (e.g., nucleus, mitochondrion)  
- terms are organized hierarchically (parent-child relationships)  
- used for annotating genes in model organisms and humans  
- GO annotations link gene products to GO terms via evidence codes (e.g., EXP, IEA, TAS)

The Gene Ontology includes both the GO term hierarchy (ontology) and gene–GO annotations for many species. 
Due to frequent updates and moderate size, it is common to download GO data on demand, or access it through tools and libraries.

GO FTP site: <http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/>  

1. Download the ontology file (`OBO` format, 30M):
```bash
wget http://current.geneontology.org/ontology/go-basic.obo
```
2. Download gene-to-GO annotations (e.g., human from Ensembl, 15M):
```bash
wget http://current.geneontology.org/annotations/goa_human.gaf.gz
```
3. Search for an example GO term (e.g., apoptosis):
```bash
curl https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/services/ontology/go/terms/GO:0006915
```
4. Use Ensembl [BioMart](http://useast.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/e03bf4380d6cb103e56668f87af7a074) or [UniProt](#uniprot) mapping tools to convert to Entrez/UniProt for GO analysis.

1. Run clusterProfiler in R environment:
```r
library(clusterProfiler)
library(org.Hs.eg.db)

# Gene list (Entrez IDs required for KEGG)
gene_list <- c("7157", "5290", "1956", "673")  # Example

# KEGG enrichment
kegg_enrich <- enrichKEGG(gene = gene_list, organism = "hsa")

# Make results readable (map Entrez → gene symbols)
kegg_enrich <- setReadable(kegg_enrich, OrgDb = org.Hs.eg.db, keyType = "ENTREZID")

# View top pathways
head(kegg_enrich)

# Plot
barplot(kegg_enrich, showCategory = 10)

- structures may be incomplete (e.g., unresolved loops or termini)  
- experimental artifacts or low resolution can affect interpretation  
- limited coverage - not all proteins or complexes have known structures  
- requires basic knowledge of molecular modeling for effective use  
- redundancy: multiple entries for the same protein (different conformations/complexes)  

</div>

{% include accordion title="Practical Tips" class=" " controls="pdb-4" icon=false %}
<div id="pdb-4" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- use the **RCSB PDB portal** for structure search by gene, ligand, or function  
- visualize structures interactively via [Mol* Viewer](https://molstar.org/) or **PyMOL**, **Chimera**, **Jmol**  
- check resolution, R-factors, and missing regions in the structure summary  
- align and compare structures using RCSB’s [Structure Alignment](https://www.rcsb.org/alignment) tools  
- cross-reference with [UniProt](#uniprot) to link sequences and functions

{% include accordion title="CLI download" class=" " controls="pdb-5" icon=false %}
<div id="pdb-5" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>
Due to the size and frequent updates of the full PDB archive, users typically download only specific structures (by PDB ID) or small subsets relevant to their study.

PDB FTP: <https://files.rcsb.org/>  

1. Download structure by PDB ID (e.g., `1A2B`, 151K):
```bash
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/1A2B.pdb
```
2. Download `mmCIF` version (preferred for newer tools, 209K):
```bash
wget https://files.rcsb.org/download/1A2B.cif
```
3. Use **pdb-tools** to manipulate files:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pdb-tools
pdb_selchain -A 1A2B.pdb > chainA.pdb
```
4. View basic structure summary via [API](https://www.rcsb.org/docs/programmatic-access/web-apis-overview):
```bash
curl https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/entry/1A2B
```

### Efficient downloads

Large biological datasets (e.g., genomes, raw reads, daily database updates) can be many gigabytes in size. 
Downloading them with plain `wget` works, but it may be slow or prone to interruption. 
Tools like **`aria2c`** and **Aspera (`ascp`)** offer faster, more reliable alternatives. 

*Use optimized tools and replace the FTP/HTTP link with the address of the file you need.* 
- use **FTP** for bulk dumps,  
- use **EDirect** for specific records by accession  


**`wget`** (simple & robust; `-c` allows resume if interrupted) or **`curl`**
```bash
wget -c ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/README.genbank
curl ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/README.genbank -o README.genbank 
```

**`aria2c`** (multi-connection downloader, not available on Atlas)
```bash
# Split file into 8 segments, download in parallel
aria2c -x 8 -s 8 ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR000/ERR000001/ERR000001_1.fastq.gz
```

**`ascp`** ([Aspera](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/data/datatransfer#data-transfer-to-ncbi); much faster for raw reads; only from [ENA](#ena)/[SRA](#sra) databases)
```bash
# syntax
ascp -i <asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh with path> -k1 -Tr –l100m anonftp@ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:/<files_to_transfer> <local_destination>
# test download
ascp -T -l640M -i /opt/aspera/etc/asperaweb_id_dsa.openssh anonftp@ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:1GB ./
```

**`esearch`** ([NCBI EDirect](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/); download by accession across INSDC)
```bash
module load edirect        
# or user-install if not available
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/entrezdirect/install-edirect.sh)"

# Fetch a nucleotide sequence in FASTA format
esearch -db nucleotide -query "NC_001666.2" | efetch -format fasta > corn_chloroplast.fasta

# Fetch the same record with full annotations (GenBank flatfile)
esearch -db nucleotide -query "NC_001666.2" | efetch -format gb > corn_chloroplast.gb

# Fetch raw read metadata by SRA/DRA/ERA accession
esearch -db sra -query "SRP433780" | efetch -format runinfo > SRP433780.csv

- Defaulting to *Arabidopsis* in all plant studies can misrepresent pathways and functions.  
- Choosing models with poor or outdated annotation reduces the value of downstream functional enrichment.  
- Ignoring phylogenetic distance may lead to incorrect orthology assignments.

- Use [Ensembl Plants](https://plants.ensembl.org/index.html), [Phytozome](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/), or [OrthoDB](https://www.orthodb.org/) to check orthology relationships.  
- Follow recommendations from community databases such as [MaizeGDB](https://www.maizegdb.org/), [WheatIS](https://www.wheatis.org/), or [TreeGenes](https://treegenesdb.org/).  
- Prefer models with strong functional annotation coverage: [GO](http://geneontology.org/), [KEGG](https://www.kegg.jp/), [Reactome](https://reactome.org/).  
- Check release notes of model organism databases - frequent updates indicate active curation.

{% include accordion title="performing functional enrichment of gene lists" controls="dp9" expanded=false class="outline" icon=false %}
<div id="dp9" class="accordion_content" markdown="1">

consider [Gene Ontology (GO)](#gene-ontology-go) for functional categories, [KEGG](#kegg)/[Reactome](#reactome) for pathway enrichment.  
- For plants, use orthology mappings to the **closest well-annotated model organism** as a reference (e.g., *Arabidopsis thaliana* for dicots, *Oryza sativa* for monocots).  
- Commonly used enrichment tools include [g:Profiler](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/), [DAVID](https://davidbioinformatics.nih.gov), and [clusterProfiler](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/clusterProfiler/).

- Running GO enrichment without background correction can inflate false positives.  
- Mixing identifiers (e.g., *RefSeq* vs. *Ensembl IDs*) may cause gene loss in enrichment.  
- Applying human-only background sets (e.g., from [gnomAD](#gnomad) or [ClinVar](#clinvar)) to plants or wildlife studies is inappropriate.  
</div>

{% include accordion title="Good to know" class="tip" controls="tip-9" icon=true %}
<div id="tip-9" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>
- Always define the **background set** (all expressed genes or all genes tested) to control enrichment properly.  
- Cross-check enriched terms across [GO](http://geneontology.org/), [KEGG](https://www.kegg.jp/), and [Reactome](https://reactome.org/) for robustness.  
- Some community portals (e.g., [MaizeGDB](https://www.maizegdb.org/), [WheatIS](https://wheatis.org/)) offer species-specific enrichment options.  
- Keep track of ontology/database **release versions** for reproducibility.

{% include accordion title="retrieving protein sequences and functional annotations" controls="dp10" expanded=false class="outline" icon=false %}
<div id="dp10" class="accordion_content" markdown="1">

consider using [UniProtKB](#uniprot) for protein sequence and functional annotation retrieval.
- **Swiss-Prot** (reviewed, curated) for high-quality annotations (ideal for reference sets, functional studies, and benchmarking)
- **TrEMBL** (unreviewed) automatically annotated sequences that expand coverage to non-model organisms and novel proteins  

***How to retrieve data?***  
- Search by *gene name*, *accession*, or *organism* in [UniProt](#uniprot).  
- Download **FASTA sequences**, **annotations**, or **complete proteomes** for your species.  
- Use programmatic access via the [UniProt REST API](https://www.uniprot.org/help/api_queries) for large-scale retrieval.  
- Cross-links to [GO](http://geneontology.org/), [KEGG](https://www.kegg.jp/), [Reactome](https://reactome.org/), [Pfam](http://pfam.xfam.org/), [InterPro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) are embedded in UniProt.

- Confusion with [GenBank](#genbank) - it accepts protein sequences but lacks curated knowledge; UniProtKB (Swiss-Prot + TrEMBL) is the best resource for protein annotations.  
- Mixing identifiers (*RefSeq*, *Ensembl*, *UniProt* accessions) without proper mapping can cause data loss.  
- Annotations are actively updated - record the **release version** used in your analysis.  
</div>

{% include accordion title="Good to know" class="tip" controls="tip-10" icon=true %}
<div id="tip-10" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>
- Use [UniProt proteome pages](https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/) to download species-specific complete proteomes.  
- The [UniProt ID mapping service](https://www.uniprot.org/id-mapping) helps convert between *RefSeq*, *Ensembl*, and *UniProt* identifiers.  
- For batch queries, upload gene or protein lists directly to UniProt’s search interface or use the REST API.  
- Swiss-Prot entries often include experimental evidence codes - useful for distinguishing reviewed from predicted annotations.

{% include accordion title="studying 3D protein structures of enzymes or receptors" controls="dp11" expanded=false class="outline" icon=false %}
<div id="dp11" class="accordion_content" markdown="1">

consider querying the [Protein Data Bank (PDB)](#pdb) for experimentally solved structures.  
- Explore structures online with the [Mol* viewer](https://molstar.org/viewer/) or locally with **PyMOL** and **Chimera**.  
- If no experimental structure exists, generate homology models: [AlphaFold 3](https://alphafoldserver.com/welcome) or [Swiss-Model](https://swissmodel.expasy.org).

- Expecting complete proteins: many PDB entries are partial or contain only specific domains.  
- Resolution varies: not all structures are high quality (check the resolution in Ångströms).  
- Structures may include engineered mutations, ligands, or missing flexible regions that do not reflect the native protein.  
</div>

{% include accordion title="Good to know" class="tip" controls="tip-11" icon=true %}
<div id="tip-11" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>
- Use the **UniProt cross-links** in protein records to find corresponding PDB entries.  
- Check [AlphaFold DB](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk) for predicted full-length structures when absent from PDB.  
- Many journals require linking to a PDB ID when publishing structural biology results.  
- For enzyme studies, [RCSB PDB](https://www.rcsb.org/) offers search filters for ligands, cofactors, and binding sites.
