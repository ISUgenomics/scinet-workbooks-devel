type: reference material

objectives: 
  - Understand the role of public databases in storing, curating, and sharing biological data.  
  - Recognize the scope and focus of major bioinformatics databases.  
  - Learn how to access, query, and download relevant datasets.  
  - Develop awareness of data integration across different databases.  

applications:
  - Retrieving reference genomes, transcriptomes, and protein sequences.  
  - Obtaining annotation files for genomic features.  
  - Accessing curated variant and disease-associated datasets.  
  - Using specialized repositories to guide experimental design and validation.  

terms: [Primary Database, Secondary Database, Data Curation, Accession Number, Metadata]

takeaways: 
  - Always check the primary source of data and the version (e.g., genome assembly build, annotation release).  
  - Be aware of redundancy and overlap - some databases mirror or repackage others.  
  - Use stable identifiers (accession numbers, Ensembl IDs, UniProt IDs) for reproducibility.  
  - Combine multiple resources to cross-validate and enrich analysis, but track provenance.  
  - Pay attention to update cycles - newer is not always better for reproducibility.

## Overview

Bioinformatics depends on **public databases** to store, organize, and share the vast amounts of biological data generated worldwide. 
These resources provide access to curated reference genomes, protein sequences, functional annotations, and clinical variants. 
They act as the foundation of reproducible research, ensuring that scientists across disciplines can work with consistent, validated, and accessible datasets.  

In this reference material, you will explore the major bioinformatics databases used in genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics. 
You’ll learn what each database contains, how to access it online, and why version tracking and stable identifiers are critical for reliable analyses.

## The role of public databases

Modern bioinformatics would not be possible without centralized, publicly available databases. 
They serve as the **infrastructure for biological discovery**, enabling researchers to access reference genomes, protein sequences, and curated annotations without recreating datasets from scratch. 
Public repositories ensure **consistency and transparency**, allowing results to be compared across studies and tools. 
They also act as **long-term archives**, preserving data generated by large international consortia as well as individual research groups.  

#### Why public databases matter?

- provide centralized access to reference data  
- reduce redundancy and duplication of effort  
- support interoperability between tools and formats  


## Primary vs. secondary databases

Databases can be broadly divided into *primary* and *secondary* resources.  

| Database     | Content | Examples | Role |
|--------------|---------|----------|------|
| **primary**  | collect raw experimental data submitted directly by researchers     | nucleotide sequences (`GenBank`, `ENA`, `DDBJ`) or high-throughput reads (`SRA`) | These repositories function as global archives for raw data retieval. |  
|**secondary** | provide high-quality sequences, annotations and specialized subsets | e.g., `RefSeq` (non-redundant reference sequences) or `UniProt` (protein function and structure) | These repositories reprocess, annotate, and curate data from primary sources. |

Understanding this distinction helps you choose the right source:  
- turn to **primary databases** when you need the *original, unprocessed experimental data*,  
- use **secondary databases** when you need *curated, standardized datasets* that are ready for analysis.  
 
<div class="highlighted highlighted--warning ">
<div class="highlighted__body"  markdown="1">
<h4 class="highlighted__heading">Before choosing a database</h4>
- **Primary databases** archive all submitted data, which means they may include redundant entries, unverified sequences, or low-quality submissions.  
- **Secondary databases** apply curation and filtering, but in doing so may omit rare variants, novel transcripts, or preliminary annotations.  

Always confirm which resource a tool or pipeline expects - using the wrong source can lead to mismatches in identifiers, missing features, or inconsistent results.  
</div>
</div>


## Standards, identifiers, curation

Databases adopt **standardized formats** (e.g., [FASTA](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#fasta) for sequences, 
[GTF](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#gtf)/[GFF](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#gff) for annotations, 
[VCF](/bioinformatics/resources/file_formats#vcf--bcf) for variants) to ensure interoperability with analysis tools. 
This consistency allows researchers to combine data from multiple sources, run them through shared pipelines, and reproduce analyses without manual reformatting.  

Every database entry is tagged with a **stable identifier** (*accession number*, *Ensembl ID*, *UniProt ID*), which acts as a permanent reference. 
This is essential for reproducibility, since gene names, annotations, and sequence versions may change over time, but the identifier remains constant.  

Finally, one of the greatest strengths of public databases lies in their use of **curation**. 
Some rely on *automated pipelines* to process submissions, while others involve *expert manual review* (e.g., `GENCODE`, `Swiss-Prot`). 
Both approaches aim to improve data quality, but awareness of their scope is essential when interpreting results.

### ★ Sequence databases

The foundation of bioinformatics is built on sequence repositories. Three primary and major **nucleotide archives**: [GenBank](#genbank), [ENA](#ena), and [DDBJ](#ddbj), work together as the 
*International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)*. Each submission to one archive is shared across all three partners, 
ensuring that the global collection of nucleotide data remains synchronized and consistent. 
In addition, curated and/or specialized resources like [RefSeq](#refseq) or [UniProt](#uniprot) provide standardized reference sequences and rich functional annotations.

- reference protein sequences for **functional genomics** and **proteomics**  
- annotation source for **homology searches**, **domain analysis**, and **pathway mapping**  
- links proteins to **genetic variants** (via UniProtKB/Var)  
- supports **systems biology** workflows by integrating with structure and pathway data  

</div>

{% include accordion title="Limitations" class=" " controls="uniprot-3" icon=false %}
<div id="uniprot-3" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- **Swiss-Prot** coverage is limited (curation is manual and slower)  
- **TrEMBL** records may contain redundant or less reliable annotations  
- multiple isoforms can be confusing; must check the **canonical sequence**  

</div>

{% include accordion title="Practical Tips" class=" " controls="uniprot-4" icon=false %}
<div id="uniprot-4" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>

- cite **UniProt accessions** (e.g., `P38398`) rather than gene names for reproducibility  
- for large-scale analyses, download **FASTA** or **XML** datasets via FTP instead of the web  
- check whether a record belongs to **Swiss-Prot (curated)** or **TrEMBL (unreviewed)**  
- use the [UniProt ID mapping service](https://www.uniprot.org/id-mapping) to convert between UniProt IDs, [RefSeq](#refseq), [Ensembl](#ensembl), and other identifiers

{% include accordion title="Download via FTP" class=" " controls="uniprot-5" icon=false %}
<div id="uniprot-5" class="accordion_content" markdown='1' hidden>
UniProt FTP site: <https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/>  

1. Download Swiss-Prot (curated proteins):  
```bash
wget ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz
```
2. Download TrEMBL (unreviewed proteins):
```bash
wget ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_trembl.fasta.gz
```
3. Download by accession (via EDirect):
```bash
# Fetch UniProt entry in text format
esearch -db protein -query "P38398" | efetch -format fasta > RAD51_protein.fasta
```
4. Programmatic query with cURL (REST API):
```bash
curl "https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P38398.fasta" -o RAD51_protein.fasta
```

- **ClinVar**  
- **gnomAD**  
- (mention 1000 Genomes, if relevant as a data source)  

### ★ Expression, Functional
- **GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus)**  
- **ArrayExpress**  
- **SRA (Sequence Read Archive)**  

### ★ Specialized databases
- **PDB (Protein Data Bank)**  
- **KEGG / Reactome** (pathways)

## Practical guidance

<div class="process-list ul" markdown="1">

### Efficient downloads

Large biological datasets (e.g., genomes, raw reads, daily database updates) can be many gigabytes in size. 
Downloading them with plain `wget` works, but it may be slow or prone to interruption. 
Tools like **`aria2c`** and **Aspera (`ascp`)** offer faster, more reliable alternatives. 

*Use optimized tools and replace the FTP/HTTP link with the address of the file you need.* 
- use **FTP** for bulk dumps,  
- use **EDirect** for specific records by accession  


**`wget`** (simple & robust)
```bash
wget -c ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/gbdaily.seq.gz
```
`-c` allows resume if interrupted.


**`aria2c`** (multi-connection downloader)
```bash
# Split file into 8 segments, download in parallel
aria2c -x 8 -s 8 ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/gbdaily.seq.gz
aria2c -x 8 -s 8 ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR000/ERR000111/ERR000111.fastq.gz
```

**`ascp`** (Aspera; much faster for raw reads)
- only from [ENA](#ena)/[SRA](#sra) databases
```bash
ascp -QT -l 300m -P33001 \
    era-fasp@fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR000/ERR000111/ERR000111.fastq.gz ERR000111.fastq.gz
```

**`esearch`** (NCBI EDirect; download by accession across INSDC)
```bash
# Fetch a nucleotide sequence in FASTA format
esearch -db nucleotide -query "NC_001666.2" | efetch -format fasta > corn_chloroplast.fasta

# Fetch the same record with full annotations (GenBank flatfile)
esearch -db nucleotide -query "NC_001666.2" | efetch -format gb > corn_chloroplast.gb

# Fetch raw read metadata by SRA/DRA/ERA accession
esearch -db sra -query "DRR000001" | efetch -format runinfo > DRR000001.csv
```
