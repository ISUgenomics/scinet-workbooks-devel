## Overview

This lesson provides a practical orientation to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies and the major assay types used to study DNA and RNA. 
You’ll learn the differences between **short-read** and **long-read** sequencing platforms, 
and how these technologies give rise to different kinds of data, challenges, and bioinformatics needs.

We’ll explore how various experimental assays are designed to answer specific biological questions, 
and how they impact downstream computational workflows. By the end of the lesson, 
you should be able to interpret sequencing metadata, evaluate basic tradeoffs between platforms and assays, and connect them to real-world research scenarios.

## What is a sequencing experiment?

A sequencing experiment begins with the extraction of nucleic acids from a biological sample, 
followed by library preparation steps that fragment the molecules and attach platform-specific adapters. 
These prepared fragments are then fed into a sequencing machine, which determines the order of nucleotide bases (`A`, `T`/`U`, `C`, and `G`) in a DNA or RNA molecule, 
and generates raw digital data in the form of reads: short sequences that represent fragments of the original nucleic acid molecules.


## Sequencing technologies

Sequencing technologies are specialized machines that read the order of nucleotide bases in DNA or RNA, producing digital sequence data used for analysis in genomics and molecular biology.

| **Generation** | **Key Features** | **Platforms** | **Use Cases** |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------|
| **FGS**        | long, accurate reads, low throughput, high cost per base      | Sanger                  | small-scale validation, targeted sequencing                                 |
| **NGS / HTS**  | short reads (50–300 bp), high accuracy, very high throughput  | Illumina                | variant calling, RNA-seq, population studies, targeted resequencing         |
| **TGS**        | long reads (10 kb+), real-time sequencing, higher error rates | PacBio, Oxford Nanopore | de novo genome assembly, metagenomics, structural variant analysis, phasing |


<div class="process-list h4" markdown="1">

#### First-generation sequencing

First-generation sequencing (**FGS**), most notably the Sanger method, was the first widely adopted approach for reading DNA. It produces long, high-accuracy reads (typically up to ~1000 bp) but is low-throughput and relatively expensive per base. While no longer used for large-scale studies, it remains valuable for small-scale validation, targeted sequencing, or applications where precision is critical and data volume is low.

#### High-throughput sequencing

Modern sequencing is often referred to as high-throughput sequencing (**HTS**) because it can generate millions to billions of reads in parallel, 
dramatically increasing data yield and reducing cost per base. This is in contrast to early Sanger sequencing, 
which was slower, lower in scale, and limited to sequencing one region at a time.

#### Next-generation sequencing

The term next-generation sequencing (**NGS**) typically refers to the first wave of [high-throughput methods](#high-throughput-sequencing) that emerged in the mid-2000s, 
revolutionizing genomics by making it feasible to sequence whole genomes, transcriptomes, and more. 
NGS is now a standard term, although [newer technologies](#third-generation-sequencing) have since emerged, pushing the boundaries of read length, accuracy, and throughput.

#### Third-generation sequencing 

Third-generation sequencing (**TGS**) refers to a set of newer technologies capable of reading individual DNA or RNA molecules in real time without prior amplification. 
TGS methods produce long reads that can span thousands to even millions of bases. These long reads simplify genome assembly, 
resolve complex structural variations, and improve phasing of haplotypes. TGS is particularly valuable when accuracy across repetitive 
or highly variable regions is critical, though it often involves higher per-read error rates that can be mitigated with specialized algorithms or hybrid approaches.

## Experimental design

Bioinformatics is rooted long before data analysis - it starts with how the sequencing experiment is designed.

Experimental design decisions shape the type, quality, and structure of sequencing data, directly impacting what bioinformatics tools and workflows can be applied. 
Factors such as [sequencing technology](#sequencing-technologies), read length, depth, assay type, and library preparation all contribute to the final dataset's characteristics.

<div class="highlighted highlighted--note ">
<div class="highlighted__body"  markdown="1">
*For example:* <br>
**Fragment size** directly affects how well reads map, especially in repetitive or low-complexity regions. Short fragments may increase ambiguity in repetitive regions.  
**read type:** Paired-end reads provide more mapping context than single-end reads.  
**read length:** Long reads may require specialized alignment tools.  
Shallow **sequencing depth** may limit statistical power in expression studies.  
Strand-specific **libraries** preserve transcription direction, which aids transcript annotation.  
</div>
</div>

As a bioinformatician, you may not always perform the sequencing yourself, but understanding how the data was generated is essential for making informed decisions later. 
This includes selecting appropriate quality control methods, choosing a compatible aligner, and ensuring the data matches the assumptions of downstream tools.

<div class="highlighted highlighted--question ">
<div class="highlighted__body"  markdown="1">

<h4 class="highlighted__heading">Before beginning analysis, always ask:</h4>
1. What biological question was the experiment designed to answer?
2. What kind of assay was used, and what are its limitations? <br>What biological signal does it capture?
3. What sequencing platform generated the data, and with what read characteristics? <br>(length, type, depth)
4. Are there technical replicates, controls, or metadata available?

Understanding these choices will help you build more accurate, reproducible, and biologically meaningful pipelines.

## Sequencing assay types

Sequencing assays define what kind of biological question the experiment is designed to answer. 
The choice of assay determines which molecules are sequenced (DNA or RNA), how the sample is processed, and what kind of analysis is required downstream.

  - 3 biological replicates per condition (e.g., control and salt-stressed roots)

**Choice rationale:**  
Plant tissues are difficult to dissociate into viable single cells due to rigid cell walls. 
snRNA-seq allows transcriptome profiling from isolated nuclei, preserving spatial and cell-type diversity. 
Barcoding and UMIs enable pooling thousands of nuclei and accurate expression quantification.

**Input:** Single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing produces **paired-end FASTQ files** with unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and cell barcodes.

**Analysis:** 
Use a **sc/snRNA-seq pipeline** such as [Cell Ranger](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger) (10x), 
followed by downstream analysis with tools like `Seurat` or `Scanpy`. Key steps include demultiplexing, UMI collapsing, alignment, count matrix generation, 
normalization, clustering, and visualization (e.g., `UMAP` or `t-SNE`). Alternatives to Cell Ranger such as `STARsolo`, `Alevin`, and `Kallisto|bustools` offer faster, 
lightweight, and more customizable workflows for sc/snRNA-seq analysis, and are especially useful for researchers needing flexibility beyond the 10x Genomics ecosystem.

**Output:** A digital **gene expression matrix** (`cells × genes`) with cell-level clustering, differential expression by cluster or condition, and inferred cell identities.

#### Example: Variant Discovery in Chickpea Cultivars

- Goal: Identify SNPs associated with drought tolerance across diverse chickpea genotypes.
- organism: *Cicer arietinum* (chickpea)
  - reference genome: CDC Frontier (v2.0)
- Assay: Whole Genome Resequencing (WGS)
- Platform: [Illumina NovaSeq](https://www.illumina.com/systems/sequencing-platforms/novaseq.html)
- Design:
  - Paired-end reads, 150 bp
  - 20×–30× genome coverage
  - 30 diverse chickpea accessions from dryland regions
  - drought-tolerant vs susceptible groups

**Choice rationale:**  
WGS provides genome-wide coverage for discovering novel and known variants. 
Chickpea has a moderately sized genome (~740 Mb), enabling cost-effective resequencing. 
This enables identification of markers linked to stress traits for marker-assisted selection or GWAS.
