## Overview

This foundational module prepares you to work in a modern bioinformatics environment, particularly on high-performance computing (HPC) platforms like [SCINet supercomputers](/about/use). 
By the end of this module, you'll be oriented to the essential concepts, public sources of datasets and computational environment required for professional bioinformatics work at scale.

## What is Bioinformatics?

Bioinformatics is the intersection of biology, computer science, and data analysis. At its core, it enables the interpretation of complex biological data using computational tools. 
While the field spans many types of biological data, ranging from proteins and metabolites to epigenetic markers, 
its foundations lie in the processing and analysis of DNA and RNA sequences generated by high-throughput sequencing technologies.  

Modern sequencing platforms such as Illumina, PacBio, and Oxford Nanopore routinely generate billions of reads per experiment. 
These reads must be organized, filtered, and transformed into biologically meaningful units (such as contigs, scaffolds, genes, or variants) through a variety of computational steps. 
Bioinformatics provides the methods and infrastructure to do this at scale.  

Public databases such as [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), [ENA](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/), and [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/) host vast repositories of genomic and transcriptomic data, 
enabling researchers to access and reuse datasets from around the world, including reference sequences, annotations, and raw sequencing data. 
These resources save time, support reproducibility, and provide valuable context for your own analyses. 

Standardized file formats such as `FASTQ`, `BAM`, and `VCF` play a critical role in ensuring that sequencing data can be seamlessly processed, 
stored, shared, and integrated across tools and platforms. This underpins efficient, scalable, and interoperable bioinformatics workflows.


## Why does Bioinformatics matter?

The pace of sequencing has accelerated beyond what traditional computational methods and infrastructures can handle. 
Since the first draft of the [human genome in 2001](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/educational-resources/fact-sheets/human-genome-project), 
sequencing [costs have dropped precipitously](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/DNA-Sequencing-Costs-Data), while data volumes have grown exponentially. 
A single sequencing run today can generate hundreds of gigabases of raw data, and entire **projects can span multiple terabytes**.

This explosion of data **demands skilled bioinformaticians** who can design reproducible analysis pipelines, navigate diverse data types and formats, 
and extract biological insight from raw sequences. The challenge is no longer just generating data - it's making sense of it efficiently, accurately, and meaningfully.

### Bioinformatics plays a central role in real-world applications

Across multiple domains, meaningful biological insight depends on reproducible bioinformatics pipelines.

- In agriculture and environmental science, it supports crop improvement, biodiversity assessment, 
and the analysis of microbial ecosystems. Genomic data also plays a key role in protecting endangered species and managing wildlife populations. 
- In medicine, bioinformatics drives the discovery of disease-causing mutations, informs cancer diagnostics through genome and transcriptome profiling, 
and enables personalized treatment strategies in precision oncology. It is also essential for tracking antimicrobial resistance and monitoring the spread of infections.
- In industrial biotechnology, bioinformatics is used to analyze and engineer microbial genomes, guiding the development of optimized strains for producing biofuels, 
enzymes, and sustainable materials. 

## Practical foundations for getting started

Bioinformatics is more than just running tools - it's about thinking critically, organizing data systematically, and making informed decisions at each step of an analysis. 
Whether you're working with raw sequencing reads or exploring annotated genomes, your ability to navigate the data with confidence depends on a few key principles:

<div class="process-list h4" markdown="1">

#### Understand the Biological Question

Before touching the data, clarify the biological hypothesis or goal. 
Bioinformatics is not a one-size-fits-all process, the right methods depend on what you want to discover: variants, gene expression, evolutionary relationships, or something else entirely.

#### Know Your Data

Familiarize yourself with the structure, origin, and limitations of your dataset. 
- *What type of sequencing was used?* 
- *What sample metadata is available?*  
- *How large is the dataset?*  

Understanding these details is essential for choosing appropriate tools and interpreting results accurately.

#### Leverage the HPC Environment Wisely

Understand the basics of [SCINet HPC system](/about/use): how to access supercomputers, submit jobs, manage resources, and store data efficiently. 
Efficient use of HPC resources not only speeds up your work but ensures you can scale analyses to meet future needs.

#### Use Consistent Project Organization

Establish clear directory structures, naming conventions, and metadata files. 
In HPC environments, well-organized projects reduce errors, ease collaboration, and enable scalable, reproducible workflows - especially when working with large datasets.

#### Work Incrementally and Log Everything

Test your pipeline on a small subset of data before scaling up. 
Keep logs, document versions of tools, and track all steps. Reproducibility is a cornerstone of good bioinformatics.

This module introduces these core concepts using real-world data examples and prepares you to work confidently in SCINet's high-performance computing (HPC) setting. 
By the end, you'll be equipped with the mindset, vocabulary, and foundational skills to begin meaningful bioinformatics research.
