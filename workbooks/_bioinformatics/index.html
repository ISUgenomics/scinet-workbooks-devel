The most effective way to master bioinformatics is by solving real-world scientific problems. 
This workbook is designed to guide you through the full lifecycle of data-driven biological inquiry: 
from experimental design to data acquisition, wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

Each module provides practical examples that mirror common challenges encountered in modern biological research, 
followed by advanced problem sets with detailed solutions. 
Together, they offer a hands-on approach that builds both conceptual understanding and technical proficiency in using tools on SCINet supercomputers.
