## What is a Terminal?

<div id="note-alerts-1" class="highlighted highlighted--note ">
    <div class="highlighted__body">
        <p>
            The terminal is a <b>software application</b> that provides a command line <i>(text-based)</i> interface (CLI) for entering and executing commands on a computer. 
            By using predefined text commands (specific words or phrases that instruct the computer to perform tasks) you can navigate the file system, 
            view or edit file content and run programs on your laptop or other computing machines, including high-performance computing (HPC) clusters.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

On any platform, you can open the Terminal (or a terminal emulator) from the graphical interface, just like any other application 
and it will appear as a window on your screen. By default, terminals often use a well-known dark theme with light text for better readability.

![terminal application - CLI tool](../assets/img/terminal-mac.png) 
*(`iTerm` terminal can be launched from the **Applications** on a macOS; terminal window looks similar across platforms)*

### Interface

The terminal interface is a simple, **text-based window** where you can type and execute commands. 
It typically displays a [prompt](/glossary/#prompt), which indicates that the terminal is ready to receive input. The prompt often includes information like the username, hostname and current directory. 
After you type a command and press `Enter`, the terminal executes it and displays the output or an error message directly below. The interface is minimalist, focusing entirely on text interaction without graphical elements.

![terminal application - CLI tool](../assets/img/terminal-interface.gif) 

### Key features

* **Input and Output:** Users type text commands (input), and the terminal displays responses or results (output). *(<a href="/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/terminal/terminal-terminology" target="_blank">see terms</a>)*
* **Customization:** Terminals can be customized with themes, fonts and shortcuts for better usability. *(<a href="/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/terminal/terminal-customization" target="_blank">see tutorial</a>)*
* **Command Help:** Learn about commands directly in the terminal by using built-in help tools. *(<a href="/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/commands/manual" target="_blank">see tutorial</a>)*
* **History and editing:** Modern terminals support command history *(<a href="/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/commands/history" target="_blank">see tutorial</a>)* 
and inline editing *(<a href="/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/commands/autocompletion" target="_blank">see tutorial</a>)* for efficiency. 
* **Remote Access:** Terminals enable users to connect to remote resources, such as SCINet HPC systems. *(<a href="/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/concepts/cli-scinet-hpc" target="_blank">see tutorial</a>)* 


### Why Terminal instead of a GUI?

The GUI provides a visual, user-friendly interface that is intuitive for basic tasks like browsing and managing individual files, 
while the CLI accessed via Terminal excels in efficiency, especially for complex or repetitive tasks, offering precision and flexibility.

![CLI vs GUI](../assets/img/cli_vs_gui.png) 
*(Graphical User Interface shows a file manager with icons and folders; Command Line Interface displays the same folder's contents in a text-based terminal using the `ls` command)*

The terminal's CLI provides unique and powerful capabilities that often surpass GUIs for both research-focused and everyday tasks, 
offering greater flexibility for repetitive steps and advanced computing needs alike.

<div id="success-alerts-1" class="highlighted highlighted--success ">
<div class="highlighted__body" markdown="1">
<h4 class="highlighted__heading">Example</h4>
Renaming thousands of image files manually in a GUI would be a time-consuming and error-prone task. With a single command in the terminal, such as a loop or a batch rename utility, 
you can quickly and accurately rename all files based on a pattern (e.g., adding a prefix or changing extensions), saving significant time and effort. <br>
*For example, this command renames all `.jpg` files in seconds.*
```
for file in *.jpg; do mv "$file" "new_$file"; done
```

## Examples of Terminal applications

Each operating system has its own set of terminal applications (or terminal emulators), but they all share common behaviors and features, 
such as text-based command input, output display and support for various **CLI environments**. 
These terminal apps allow users to interact with the system's CLI, manage files, run commands and connect to remote systems such as SCINet HPC.

<div id="note-alerts-1" class="highlighted highlighted--note ">
<div class="highlighted__body">
<p markdown="1">
CLI environments refer to the underlying **shells that interpret and execute the commands** entered in a terminal. 
These environments, like `Bash`, `Zsh` or `PowerShell`, define the syntax and functionality available for command-line interaction with the specific operating system.
</p>
</div>

<div id="highlighted-alerts-1" class="highlighted highlighted--highlighted ">
<div class="highlighted__body">
<p markdown="1">In this lesson module, we focus on CLI tools ([terminal apps](/glossary/#terminal)) that support the **[Unix shell](/glossary/#unix-shell)**, a widely-used CLI environment ([command interpreter](/glossary/#cli-environment)). It is the standard for accessing and operating on HPC systems (including SCINet clusters), 
    making it an essential tool for advancing the computational aspects of your research.
