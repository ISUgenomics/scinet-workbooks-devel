# Overview

This interactive tutorial focuses on command autocompletion, a powerful shell feature that enhances efficiency by predicting and completing command names *(built-in, aliases, function names, binaries on $PATH)*, filenames and arguments. By learning how to use `Tab`-based autocompletion, you can minimize typing errors and navigate the command line more effectively. This tutorial provides hands-on exercises for mastering autocompletion in Bash (Unix shell), particularly within SCINet HPC clusters.
