## What is a Shell Function?

<div id="note-alerts-1" class="highlighted highlighted--note ">
<div class="highlighted__body" markdown="1">
A shell function in Unix-like systems is a user-defined **block of commands** that can be grouped together and executed **under a single function name**. 
Shell functions are designed **to simplify repetitive tasks** or complex workflows by allowing users to write a sequence of commands once and then call them as needed, 
**with the added benefit of passing arguments** for dynamic behavior.
```bash
greet_user() {
    echo "Hello, $1! Welcome to the SCINet system."
}
# Function call with argument
greet_user "Alice"
```
Unlike [aliases](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/customization/aliases), which only provide a static shortcut for commands, 
functions allow for logic, argument passing, conditionals and loops, making them much more powerful and flexible.
</div>
</div>

When you define a shell function, you're essentially creating a mini-program within your shell session. Functions can take positional arguments (`$1`, `$2`, etc.), 
allowing users to provide input dynamically when calling the function. Functions are a core tool for automation and reusability, especially in HPC environments, 
where repetitive tasks such as job submissions, log monitoring and resource checks are common. By defining command sequences as functions, users can improve efficiency abd reduce errors.

| key characteristics | core benefits |

| **Defined with a name and reusable** <br>Functions can be invoked anywhere within the shell session using their name.                                              | **Automation** <br>Automate complex multi-step tasks in a single reusable function. |
| **Dynamic and flexible** <br>They can accept arguments (`$1`, `$2`), which are passed during execution, making them ideal for handling different input scenarios.  | **Efficiency** <br>Eliminate repetitive manual commands while allowing flexibility through argument passing. |
| **Support complex logic** <br>Functions can include conditionals (`if` statements), loops and even other function calls, offering enhanced control and automation. | **Error reduction** <br>Minimize errors by writing logic once and reusing it, avoiding manual typos or omissions. |

Shell functions are integral to [shell customization](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/customization/index) and complement other tools like 
[aliases](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/customization/aliases), [environment variables](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/variables) 
and [startup scripts](/computing-skills/command-line/cli-interface/shell/customization/bashrc). 
Together, they form a robust environment for tailoring the command line to fit specific needs, including routine daily tasks in HPC infrastructure or hihly customized workflows specific to user or project.


### Purpose of Shell Functions

Shell functions are a powerful mechanism for **automating workflows and reducing code duplication**. By grouping commands, handling dynamic inputs and embedding logic, 
functions can streamline tasks that would otherwise require lengthy sequences of commands or repetitive code blocks in scripts.

The primary purpose of shell functions is to reduce redundancy and enable modular, reusable workflows in shell scripting. Functions enable users to:
* **group multiple commands** under one name to streamline complex tasks
* **use arguments** to dynamically change behavior or input parameters
* **enhance automation** by incorporating loops, conditionals and error handling

<div id="note-alerts-1" class="highlighted highlighted--success ">
<div class="highlighted__body" markdown="1">
When working on a cluster you need to repeatedly check job statuses and derive statistics to monitor progress and identify any bottlenecks. Instead of typing multiple commands each time, 
you can create a function that encapsulates this entire routine and executes it with a single call. Once saved and stored in a configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`), 
it can be reused indefinitely by calling its name.
</div>
</div>

*Example shell function to quickly derive statistics on jobs in the queue*

```bash
job_stats() {
    local user=${1:-$USER}          # specify user.name or use $USER as default
    
    # Count running and pending jobs
    running_jobs=$(squeue -u "$user" -t RUNNING | wc -l)
    pending_jobs=$(squeue -u "$user" -t PENDING | wc -l)
    
    # Find the job with the longest running time
    longest_running=$(squeue -u "$user" -o "%A %L %j" --sort=-L | head -n 2 | tail -n 1)
    
    # Find the most recently started job
    most_recent=$(squeue -u "$user" -o "%A %S %j" --sort=-S | head -n 2 | tail -n 1)

    # Display the results
    echo "Running jobs: $((running_jobs - 1))"  # Subtract header line
    echo "Pending jobs: $((pending_jobs - 1))"  # Subtract header line
    echo "Longest-running job: $longest_running"
    echo "Most recently started job: $most_recent"
}

# usage for current user:   job_stats()
# usage for any user:       job_stats() user.name
```
![function job stats](../../assets/img/function_job_stats.png)

By encapsulating all steps into a single shell function `job_stats` you can quickly get useful statistics such as:
- the total number of running and pending jobs
- the longest-running job
- the most recently started job

Additionally, a function offers flexibility by dynamically generating statistics for the current user (`$USER`) by default, 
while also allowing the option to specify any other user when needed.

- Comparison of scope: functions vs. aliases.
- When to use a function instead of an alias.
- Differences in complexity and flexibility (e.g., argument passing, logic control).
