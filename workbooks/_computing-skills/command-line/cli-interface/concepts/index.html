        <p>
            The command line interface (CLI) is a text-based method of interacting with a computer system. 
            Instead of using a graphical interface with windows and icons, users type all commands directly into a terminal <i>(the interface tool)</i> to perform tasks. 
            The CLI offers precise control over the system, making it a powerful tool for customized tasks and automation.
        </p>

**The role of the CLI in user-system interaction**

The CLI serves as a direct communication channel between the user and the computer's operating system.
It is a text-based environment where all interactions happen in a single window. Users type commands to instruct the computer. 
The computer responds with text messages or outputs. This creates a simple and efficient way to communicate with the system, 
directly interacting with the computer's core functions without relying on visual, clickable components.

<div id="highlighted-alerts-1" class="highlighted highlighted--highlighted ">
    <div class="highlighted__body">
        <p>All actions taken in the CLI are permanent and reflected in the GUI as well. </p>
        <em>For example, if you create a file using a CLI command, you can see the file appear in the GUI's file manager.</em>
    </div>
</div>


### The core concepts of the CLI

<div class="usa-accordion">

    {% include accordion title="Universal compatibility across systems" class="outline " controls="cli-concept-1" %} 
    <div id="cli-concept-1" class="accordion_content">    
        <p>The CLI is not tied to any specific system or platform. Whether you're using Linux, macOS, Windows or even computing cluster, 
        many commands and tools follow similar principles, making CLI knowledge highly transferable. This universality allows users to apply 
        their knowledge on various platforms, from personal laptops to powerful servers and high-performance computing clusters.</p>
    </div>

    {% include accordion title="A single window for all tasks" class="outline " controls="cli-concept-2" %}
    <div id="cli-concept-2" class="accordion_content">
        <p>In the CLI, there are no multiple windows, buttons or icons like in a GUI. Everything you do <i>(whether it's navigating directories, 
        managing files or running programs)</i> happens within one text-based interface.</p>
        <em>Think of it as a conversation: you type a command (your input) and the system responds with a result (its output), all in the same window.</em>
    </div>

    {% include accordion title="Streamlined user-system interaction" class="outline " controls="cli-concept-3" %} 
    <div id="cli-concept-3" class="accordion_content">    
        <p>While the CLI may appear minimal, it is incredibly powerful. With a few keystrokes, you can perform complex tasks, 
        automate workflows and combine multiple commands, all without switching between windows or menus.</p>
    </div>

    {% include accordion title="Text-based input and output in the command-line" class="outline " controls="cli-concept-4" %} 
    <div id="cli-concept-4" class="accordion_content">    
        <p>All interactions in the CLI involve text. You type commands as instructions, and the system replies in text. </p>
        <em>For example, asking to see the contents of a directory will result in a plain-text list of files. <br>
        If something goes wrong or needs attention, the system will explain the issue in a text-based message.</em>
    </div>

    {% include accordion title="Navigate the file system with commands" class="outline " controls="cli-concept-5" %} 
    <div id="cli-concept-5" class="accordion_content">
        <p>The CLI allows you to move through your computer's file system using simple commands. </p>
        <em>For example, you can "change location" by typing a <b>cd</b> command to switch directories/folders. <br>
        This is similar to opening and closing folders in a GUI, but it's done entirely through text. </em>
    </div>

    {% include accordion title="Access to hidden system features" class="outline " controls="cli-concept-6" %} 
    <div id="cli-concept-6" class="accordion_content">    
        <p>Many system functionalities, tools and configurations are accessible only through the CLI. 
        This includes advanced tools for process management, system monitoring and administrative tasks, which are often not available in GUI interfaces.</p>
    </div>

    {% include accordion title="Error handling and feedback" class="outline " controls="cli-concept-7" %} 
    <div id="cli-concept-7" class="accordion_content">    
        <p>The CLI provides immediate feedback for every command. Errors include helpful messages that guide users to correct mistakes, making it an effective way to learn and troubleshoot.</p>
    </div>

### How does CLI differ from GUI?

The primary difference between CLI and GUI lies in how users interact with the system. 
- GUIs are user-friendly and intuitive, but they can be slower and less flexible for advanced tasks. 
- In contrast, the CLI is ideal for repetitive actions, scripting and working with large amounts of data.

![GUI vs CLI](../assets/img/cli_vs_gui.png)

| aspect | GUI | CLI |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Layout          | Multiple windows and graphical elements, often organized in a layered or desktop-style interface. | Single text-based window where all interactions occur. |
| Interaction     | Users interact with visual elements like icons, buttons, and menus, primarily using a mouse.      | Commands are typed using a keyboard, requiring familiarity with specific syntax. |
| User Input      | Combines mouse clicks and keyboard inputs for intuitive interaction.                              | Relies solely on keyboard inputs for navigation and task execution. |
| Feedback        | Visual feedback is provided through changes in graphics, animations and pop-ups.                  | Responses are displayed as plain text or lists directly in the same window. |
| Navigation      | Navigation is performed by clicking through hierarchical folders or graphical menus.              | File system and directories are navigated using typed commands like `cd` and `ls`. |
| Accessibility   | Designed to be more intuitive and accessible to beginners without prior knowledge.                | Requires knowledge of commands and syntax to use effectively. |
| Customization   | Limited customization, primarily through settings and pre-built themes.                           | Highly customizable with scripts, aliases and configuration files. |
| Resource Usage  | Resource-intensive due to graphics and multiple active elements.                                  | Lightweight, as it doesn't require graphical processing. |
| Task Complexity | Best suited for straightforward, one-off tasks that benefit from visual interaction.              | Ideal for handling complex and repetitive tasks through scripting and automation. |
| Learning Curve  | Shallower learning curve, as visual cues guide the user.                                          | Steeper learning curve due to the need to memorize commands and syntax. |


### Why use CLI? Benefits over GUI

The CLI provides several key advantages that make it beneficial for advanced or large-scale tasks:

* **Speed:** Tasks can be performed more quickly by typing commands instead of navigating through menus.
* **Precision:** Commands offer granular control over system operations. You can customize tasks.
* **Automation:** Scripts allow repetitive tasks to be automated, saving time and effort.
* **Scalability:** The CLI is well-suited for managing large-scale operations, such as processing thousands of files.
* **Remote Accessibility:** The CLI can be connected remotely over secure protocols like SSH, providing access to HPC.
* **Universality:** Many CLI tools and commands work across platforms, providing a consistent interface.
* **Lightweight Operation:** Since the CLI doesn't require graphical resources, it's ideal when working remotely on HPC.

### Examples of CLI environments 

Different operating systems provide various tools and shells for working with the Command Line Interface. 
Each CLI tool serves as the entry point to interact with a shell, which interprets and executes your commands.
It's important to differentiate between:
- **CLI tools**, i.e., interfaces you use to enter commands and 
- **shells**, i.e., command interpreters that process those commands.
