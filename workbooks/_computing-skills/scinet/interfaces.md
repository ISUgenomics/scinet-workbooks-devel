terms: [SCINet supercomputers, Local Machine, Open OnDemand, Web Browser, Unix Shell, Development environment, IDE]

objectives: 
  - Understand the different interfaces available on SCINet for interacting with the system.
  - Learn when and why to use Shell, RStudio, JupyterLab, or VS Code depending on research needs.
  - Learn how graphical and command-line interfaces complement each other in scientific computing.
  - Select the most effective interface for different stages of a project.

applications:
  - Logging into the Shell for command-line tasks such as file management or job submission.
  - Using RStudio for statistical analysis, data visualization, and R-based research pipelines.
  - Running JupyterLab for interactive Python development, notebook-based workflows, data exploration.
  - Leveraging VS Code for advanced code editing, debugging, and multi-language project development.

takeaways:
    - All interfaces connect to the same underlying resources on SCINet, ensuring a consistent computing environment.
    - Choosing the right interface saves time and improves productivity. Use Shell for system operations, notebooks for exploratory work, and IDEs for structured development.
    - Shell provides essential control over the system and is often the starting point for HPC tasks.
    - RStudio, JupyterLab, and VS Code make it easier to develop, visualize, and debug code in familiar environments.
    - Mastering multiple interfaces allows for flexibility in workflows and smoother collaboration with colleagues.

An activated SCINet account with confirmed login access is required before using any interface.  
If you need a SCINet account, please refer to [Getting started with SCINet](/computing-skills/scinet/) for instructions.

## Overview

{% include overviews %}


## Getting started

First, you will log in through **Open OnDemand (OOD)** in your web browser and explore the available interfaces.

### Choose an interface

There are multiple different interfaces available on SCINet.  In this section, we provide template instructions for launching these interfaces and provide an overview of each input parameter.

- [Launch the Shell](#launch-the-shell)
- [Launch RStudio](#launch-rstudio)
- [Launching JupyterLab](#launch-jupyterlab)
- [Launching VS Code](#launch-vs-code-only-available-on-ceres) *(only available on Ceres)*

<div class="highlighted highlighted--highlighted"><div class="highlighted__body" markdown="1"> 
Note: Each tutorial may have specific inputs depending on the resource needs and objectives of the tutorial.  Use the parameters specified by the tutorial if they differ from these demo instructions.

<div class="process-list ul" markdown="1">

{% include setup/ood_shell %}

From here, your tutorial may have specific instructions for you to execute.  One of the first steps is often to [request a compute note and create a working directory in /90daydata](#making-your-workspace-directory-in-90daydata), as explained above.

Requesting a compute node keeps all the intense computation off the login nodes, so that login nodes can have all the resources necessary for managing the cluster. **Please do not run your applications on the login nodes**.   For more information, see our [SLURM guide](https://scinet.usda.gov/guides/use/slurm). 

### Launch RStudio 
Back on the main Atlas/Ceres OOD tab, click on the top or side navigation bar: "Interactive Apps" > "RStudio Server".
